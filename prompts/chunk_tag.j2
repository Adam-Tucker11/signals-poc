You are labeling transcript chunks with EXISTING taxonomy topics only.

Existing topics (IDs): {{ taxonomy_ids|join(", ") }}

For each chunk, if it clearly mentions one of those topics, return a mention with:
- chunk_id
- topic_id (must be exactly the taxonomy id)
- topic_label (human-readable label; can equal the id)
- evidence (verbatim phrase/sentence from the chunk)
- relevance (number 0.0â€“1.0)

Relevance guidance:
- 0.15 = casual reference/name-drop
- 0.50 = concrete problem/need
- 0.90+ = decision/commitment/actionable plan

Chunks (JSON):
{{ chunks_json }}

Return JSON that validates against the provided schema.
