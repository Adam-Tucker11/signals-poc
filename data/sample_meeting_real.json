Um\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 One thing, one that's kind of a bigger idea, a newer idea, maybe you could say. Be good to start with that one, probably. Um\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It's kind of a build on what we talked about, I think it was\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 was it two weeks ago, or maybe it was last week, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I had a\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I had a comp for\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Like, a live meetings. 2.0 type I\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I feel like, um\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A couple of products that I've been using lately, and just a\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 just a sense, kind of from you, Adam, and I think somebody else mentioned it too, but, like. I feel like the idea of just ambient\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 like an ambient AI\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 makes a lot of sense for product forge in some ways, right? Because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You're doing a lot of chatting to build out stories."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Rich Theil",
      "text": "What's a story with everything, yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Luke",
      "text": "Oh, okay, it was Kaiser. It was Kaiser, because, uh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, because I felt like for him, it's like, okay, he's solo, he's, like, building a product, it's like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And then we're, like, showing them, we're like, hey, here's, like. These meetings, and, like, you can have meetings, and then, like, with your team, and it's like, he doesn't have a team, he doesn't have\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you know, meetings, really, or maybe he does, but they're, like, kind of different than ever thinking about. And I was like. One of the thought experiments was, like, how do we\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 how can we kind of, uh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 push\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 push into a direction. Allows you to use the power of the meeting, but it doesn't necessarily have to be. Uh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 like, with your team. I mean, obviously, it could be with your team, but it's more like. Um, you know, could it work as kind of a connected audio mode?"

      "speaker": "Rich Theil",
      "text": "You're fine, dude. It's\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 yeah, it's workable."

    {
      "speaker": "Adam Tucker",
      "text": "Your audio's fine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Luke",
      "text": "Yeah, but I'll try. Okay. Yeah, okay, cool. Well, just tell me if it gets worse, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Okay, so let me just orient you to this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what's going on here. So this person, this PM. Is Alex Morgan. Alex is, like, looking at the daily, just came into product for us, like, yeah, cool, well, daily, awesome. Love it. Uh, and then Alex realizes we need to kick off a new project, I want to get that ready. And so, maybe the way that Alex does this, maybe\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He goes to this little three dots in Smith, and goes, like, listening mode, okay? Listening mode, basically. Takes us to this new state. And the new state here is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 let's connect to a meeting in the same way that. Uh, live meetings does today, but this is, like. You're almost thinking about it as just localized to Smith. Right? It's not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Of course, it can do everything that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It can\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 we can do today, but so, we're like, cool, let's set up\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 set up a\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 let's set up a\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 an audio stream. What\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 where do we want to go from? This is for a couple of reasons, too. Like, one, the web audio sucks. It's 5 minutes max, it's\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the transcription's really not great. So we really\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 if we want to do this ambient mode, we want to do it with, like. A real\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a real application that can do it. I mean, Slack might be one of the more interesting ones. Which we call this support, but yeah, one of these three, or something else, but another app. So we're like, yeah, let's connect. So we connect. And now we're connected to the Zoom. And the user gets this tip, hey, like, you can interact directly with Smith. You can, like, talk to Smith. Smith's also gonna listen, so we get this new state change where it's like, okay, Smith's listening to me. We see that the chat goes away, or at least it's hidden. So it starts to prompt me, like, okay, this isn't really about chatting anymore, it's about something different. And so the PM\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 so these little\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 these little cartoon boxes down here will symbolize the PM talking. Hey, we need a way to standardize the user stories, we want to create some new templates, you know, the PM just starts talking, essentially. Smith kind of, like, listens and responds, like, oh, wow, okay, sounds like a new project. Do you want to create an artifact templates project? Like, uh, yes, I can say\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I can say, you know, I can edit the name, I can just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 not do anything with that. Um, so let's say the user's like, yeah, okay, cool. So Smith just creates the project, just like it would if you had typed, hey Smith, create a project, right? But\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I'm just using my voice. So the idea here is, like, hey, let's use voice and just quick commands. For a lot of things, can\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what can we get out of that? So then, the user makes that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 makes that project, Smith says, great, created the project. I can write a short description based on what you said. Do you want to review it, or do you want to just do it? He's just like, let's review it. So again, Smith uses the same tool called\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it's a very similar UI and UX to when you use tool calls. Within the chat experience, except that. You don't necessarily have, like. A lot of back-and-forth messages. Smith is kind of just a one-way. In this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 in this example. So\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Let's say that Smith revises the description, and you're like, yeah, looks great. I mean, ad is probably not the right. We're there, but, like, yes or no, and you're like, yeah. So, we updated the project. Again, this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this pane is completely independent. I can navigate independently, do anything that I want to, just like normal Smith. That you can. So Smith can do all this stuff, and you're gonna get, like, receipts here. So, the project gets\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 oh yeah, this is important. So you're just like, cool, let's go see this project. Clicks on the project. Boom. Now we're in the project, artifact templates. Smith notices that the project. Now, notices that the context has shifted to this new project, like, hey. We got this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 we got this project, we can start building out stories, do you want to talk about strategic goals, research? You get, like, a little actions tray. This would have a bunch of different quick actions. But the PM goes, let's start with the North Star. For this one. What do you suggest? And Smith's like, okay, cool, let's think a little bit. Yeah, great. A North Star goal is going to anchor the project. Let's tell me more\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what else do you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what do you want in this North Star? Is it about customization? You know, it might\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it might list out a bunch of things here, like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Ask questions. The PM, instead of saying yes or no here, the PM goes, it is about customization, but we want to measure it with data. It's just like, okay, cool. How about this idea? Percentage of new artifacts with templates. Maybe it could be 25% in the first 2 weeks. You know, Smith is responding. These are not doing a good job illustrating that, but Smith is responding. Like, yeah, that sounds good. Cool. Updates the project. Right? And then writes it into the summary. Update the summary with this North Star metric, like, cool, that looks great. Now let's\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 now that PM goes, let's work on some user stories. I want to scope things down. Right? Let's not get our engineer overwhelmed. We're gonna need a feature flag, and the PM could just be talking. I mean, this is just kind of generally talking. And this prototype doesn't do a great job, but, like. I would have had to make, like, basically 5 screens for every one, right? Because the first screen would just be the talking, and then Smith would be like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 yes, great, I'll start making the\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There would be a lot of state movement here, and I just didn't want to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 make, like, I already made, like, 30 screens, so making 90 would have been\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Terrible, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 so basically\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 So imagine, like, these are, like, there's kind of some back and forth here, but the PM's like, yeah, great. So Smith starts working on the stories. We generate the stories, again, just like we would. In normal chat. And the mechanics are kind of the same. I think the differences were just piping the sections from the meeting transcript. Into some of the different, you know, there might be a centralized thing that's listening to that, and then that might be sending. Some messages over to Smith somehow, but basically, yeah, like. This mode, the real difference is that input is coming from. Transcripted text, not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 typed text, right? And, um, but we still have, like, the message thread history. Like, you could open this history. So, like, one of the things that I realized was, like. Hey, it's not going to be this linear thing where it's like, assistant, user, assistant, user, the messages don't just flow that way, they're kind of more\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, they're just kind of, like, they can be more\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 feel more one-off. So, sometimes things get hidden, as you'll notice throughout this, like, there's only, like, one or two bubbles from Smith at all times. You're not just seeing, like, a huge thread. You could open the whole history if you wanted to see, like. Everything that you had talked about in this, but it's more like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don't want to see that, I want it to just feel more like Smith is listening. Smith responds whenever I need response. Smith might offer something proactively, but that's not very common. And then I have\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I can also be like, Smith, generate a user story. Like, if I, you know, keyword into Smith, like. That's the way to kind of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That's my direct way, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Okay, so we got these issues, the issue's like, cool, let's go check them out. Jumps over to the issues, uh, it's like, okay, let's look at this one, this template. They're like, yeah. So, we look at the template, and this one's like, uh, it's fine, but I've got some documentation to enrich this. So the user clicks Enable Chat. Right? And this is just really to show, like, you could enable the chat, you could paste in a bunch of text. This is like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 In Cloud Code, they do this thing that I think is really nice, where. If I paste something into Cloud Code, it doesn't just show me, like, the giant. Thing. It just, like, concatenates it that way, and then, like, behind the scenes, they handle it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Adam Tucker",
      "text": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Luke",
      "text": "Anyways, that's just a thing that was on my mind. That I wanted to put in here. But, so then the user's like. So this is a scenario where I was trying to sketch out the scenario where when is text actually better than talking? And, like, this might be an example, you're like. I've got some docs, or I've got a URL that I want to look at, or I've got, you know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you've got something that text makes a lot more sense than actually talking that out. So you could paste that in, hit go. It's like, cool, Smith's gonna, like, think about that, and like, great, I've read the document. I made some updates. It's gonna give you the description, you know, again, it's gonna give you the updates, kind of, in the other way, and you can do, like, update, and that would then update this, like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But again, yeah, it's kind of like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I think this is, like, what I would say about this prototype is I think it covers about. 5% of the actual use cases of what you could do with voice and ambient mode. It's not a very good. It's not a very complete visual of what that could be like, but the whole\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the three things that I want to. To display here, one. The\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the state where Smith is listening is very similar to the state where you're chatting with Smith. The difference is just that you're not chatting. And, uh, it's reactive, right? That's two, you can move around the app, right? So let's pretend this was actually a refinement meeting. It wasn't\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it's not a, um\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You know, it's not just a solo\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a solo deal. You could\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 instead of having to go to live meetings and be like, I gotta pre-make all these stories or all these things, you can just be like, let's go to this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 let's go to this meeting I had yesterday. I want to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I want to share with\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 with you guys what happened in this meeting. Look at this. Okay, make a story. Hey, let's go over to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You know, let's look at some feedback that we got, right? Like, you're able to just kind of, like, use the app, and then\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the conversation should sort of brew, and. Let Smith give you some stuff. I didn't\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and I didn't put this in here, but this is another important point. I think you should be able to, like, ignore, or, like, it's not like everything that Smith is saying is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 should be, like. Gospel to the conversation, you know? Like, there will be times where you're just talking with the team, and you're having a discussion, and someone's like, do you want me to research this thing? And you're like, no. No, we don't. You know, like, that's gonna happen, right? This is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 for the solo mode, I do think it's a bit, uh, easier to figure out what's going on, because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there's not a whole discussion to capture between multiple parties, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think, like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The benefits here are just, like, the UX is obviously a bit\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 can be streamlined if it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 if it works. And then, um, you know, the other thing is just, like, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There are actually a lot of apps right now playing in the space of audio, like Super Whisperer and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 monologue, and there's a bunch of other apps. And they're trying to, like, be the voice layer. To control these other experiences that are mainly\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 they're mainly keyboard-based. And I think that, like, we have the option to be, like. Hey, we're keyboard-based, but you can use one of these other apps to control us on top, like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Um, that's kind of what I've been playing around with this week. Or, we could build that mode in where. Because we already have the transcriptions, because we already have the live. Um, stuff, it's just a\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, and again, we kind of tried with, uh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We tried with our last go-around to make this better, and it was still tricky. I'm not saying that I\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that I've come up with all the answers, technically, on how to get through this, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I do think that, like, maybe if we rethought about it, instead of just the generation endpoints. Imagine that it was actually. Um\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It's actually just chat. It, like, literally is the Smith chat. But instead of sending user messages every time, we're, like, kind of hiding that from the UI, almost. But it's still getting sent. Right? It's still getting into the conversation, it's just sort of in a different way. And I think that will make all these tools work, and allow us to kind of use all the stuff we've built for chat. But just in kind of a different way. And then, uh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, I don't know. Might be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Might be a compelling way for somebody like Kaiser, somebody like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Adam, or somebody who, like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think for, like, building out. You know, a large\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a large\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 group of work without, like, having to type a ton of stuff. It really\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It makes sense. Maybe you want to talk for, like, 5 minutes, and just have Smith just listen to that, right? And then go, like, okay, cool. Now let's respond and do stuff. Um\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, so anyways, that's\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that's sort of the whole\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that's\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that's one of the flows here. Um. I know that's a lot of coverage."

Basically, to, like, watch the last 5 minutes or something, but basically. She was like, yeah, and then earlier in the meeting, she was like, I use ChatGPT to write my user stories, and blah blah blah. And we came towards the end of the meeting, and this was gonna be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 like, I don't know, I just wanted to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I felt like pressing it a little bit, so I was like, listen, if you're writing stories in\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ChatGPT, why in the world would you use ProductForge? Like, because she was a product owner. She wasn't a product manager, she's a product owner at a consulting company. Her job is to write stories. Like, that's her value prop inside ProductFork, you know? And it turns out that was not our value prop inside product form. She was like, yeah, but you've got, like, everything blended together, and it's just so seamless transitioning between. The tools and the capabilities and sort of that, like, that, like, flow work to her was really, like, a compelling enough reason to say that she would switch to ProductForge. Um, and so you breaking down, or us breaking down more barriers in terms of experience and all that is, like."

Like, the other simplification\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the only other simplification idea that I've had is one that I've seen you do, so it probably came from you, but it's like, hey, Smith. Xyz, like, right? Um, and this is like that. It's like, it's a half a step simpler, like, you're just in that mode, everything that you say is a command.

Today, I've been actually using this, like, uh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this other\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this transcription app, basically, that sits above cursor, and instead of typing anything that I would type in cursor, I've just been talking to it. And it's kind of like, there's a little\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there's things I really like about it, there's things that are, like, weird about it that I don't like, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think that's the hard part. The hard part here is, like. How do we actually. Uh, like, these apps work, right, because I say\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I press record, I talk, talk, talk, talk, it transcribes it and sends it, and it just works. This is a little different because it's, like, everything is going\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 we're not, like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it's not, like, totally command-driven, like, hey, Smith, just do X. Smith, do Y, like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It still should be able to have the conversation, and maybe that's\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Maybe that's where, like, the post\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 post-meeting, or, like, when you disconnect the meeting, you get, like, the post stuff. I don't know, like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But yeah, there's a lot of questions to solve, but at least, I think one. Thing that might be able to be true is just, hopefully we can get all the stuff that Smith can do in chat mode. We\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 if we can do that when we're connected to a meeting. That would be, like, a very\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you know, that's kind of a proof of concept in terms of. And maybe it's voice command, right? Maybe that is the way that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Uh, we start, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, it's\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think there's gonna be some major breakthroughs in this area, especially with stuff, like, with chat and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 other products. They've done well, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think there's gonna be more to that, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Anyways\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 yeah, as far as the proof of concept, I don't know. It's\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it's kind of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think we need to talk more about it and just figure out, like, how\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 how can we really narrow it down even more?

Not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it gets weird from the sense that, like, it might influence how this. Bots thinking about stuff. So you might be able to be like, hey, just, like, stop listening for, like.

But, like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think the smaller things are interesting to react to. Like, the voice commands, right? You'd want that to be, like, pretty fast. If you said, hey Smith, let's navigate to this project page, right? Let's go. You know, or hey, Smith, like, let's update this AC to include XYZ. Like, those type of things are kind of where you want the short stuff, and then\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 when it's looking\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it might look at the sections, and that might be where it comes with a response\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 with a reaction.

This is just, like, my idea of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Smith seems like it's working really well in chat. How could we, like, adapt that for a really nice, you know, ambient mode that's. Kind of takes away some of the\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 clutter of, like, the chat experience, the back and forth.

Like, I've definitely seen, like. Dictate where I tell it something, it transcribes me into\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 text, and then it sends that message, like, that's\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That's a\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that's something that we have, and we can do better on, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Um, yeah, so. It's a bit of a technical\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it might be a bit of a technical challenge, to be honest, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Um, yeah. I don't know. I also feel like I don't think users are really, like.

It does go back to first principles, like paradigms that they\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 so one thing is, like, they\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They optimistically change state on everything. So, like. You know, you change a project, and, like, they just do it, and then they make the API call. In the background, we're the opposite. We'll be like, oh, change projects? Let's hit the API, wait for the response. Okay, cool, it was great, now we'll change, you know. So, I think just stuff like that, and like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 as much as we can. Being a little bit more, um\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you know, not having, like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 like, another thing is just, like, having more skill\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 stuff like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you know, skeleton loader, where you're like. You're gonna see a page with a bunch of things that look like this. For about 2 seconds. You know, instead of seeing a giant loading indicator on every\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I feel like that's\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Part of what's bugging me now about the app is, like, every, you know, every link that I hit in here."
